## Introduction

The Employee Wage System is designed to track and manage employee wages based on various factors such as presence, working hours, employee types (full-time, part-time), and different companies. This system helps automate the wage calculation process and keeps track of total wages for each company.

## Use Case Details

### _Use Case 1_ - Check Employee Presence
This use case checks if an employee is present for work or not, based on predefined conditions.

### _Use Case 2_ - Calculate Daily Employee Wage
Calculates the daily wage for an employee, typically based on hours worked and the hourly wage rate.

### _Use Case 3_ - Part-time Employee & Wage Calculation
Handles wage calculation for part-time employees who work fewer hours than full-time employees.

### _Use Case 4_ - Wage Calculation using Case Statement
Implements the calculation of wages using a case statement to handle different conditions (e.g., full-time, part-time, overtime).

### _Use Case 5_ - Monthly Wage Calculation
Calculates the total monthly wage for an employee based on daily wages.

### _Use Case 6_ - Wage Calculation with Work Hour Constraints
Calculates wages based on constraints, such as a maximum number of work hours per day.

### _Use Case 7_ - Refactor Code to Use Class Methods
Refactor the existing code to use object-oriented principles, specifically class methods for better structure and maintainability.

### _Use Case 8_ - Wage Calculation for Multiple Companies
Calculates wages for employees working in multiple companies, handling each company's rules independently.

### _Use Case 9_ - Store Total Wage for Each Company
Keeps track of the total wage paid by each company to its employees.

### _Use Case 10_ - Manage Multiple Companies' Wages (Interface Approach)
Provides an interface to manage the wages of employees across multiple companies in a flexible and scalable way.

### _Use Case 11_ - Manage Wages using API Approach
Uses an API to manage employee wages, allowing external systems to interact with the wage data.

### _Use Case 12_ - Store Daily and Total Wages
Stores the daily wage for each employee and calculates the total wage for a period (e.g., weekly or monthly).

### _Use Case 13_ - Query Total Wage by Company
Enables querying of the total wage data for a specific company.

### _Use Case 14_ - Final Implementation
The final implementation integrates all the previous use cases into a cohesive system for managing employee wages.
